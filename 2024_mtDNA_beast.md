I am on info here:

```

Here are the calibration points:
From Feng et al. 2017
pipoidea 146.7–171.4: 159; sd 5
pipidae 91.7–117.7  105; sd 5
africanpipidae 104.2–130.9  118, sd 5
xenopus 34.2–57.9 46, sd 

From Session et al. 2016
subgenusXenopus 18, sd 5

All other settings are the same as in Evans et al. 2019
