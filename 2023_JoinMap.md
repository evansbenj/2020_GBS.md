# JoinMap

I found the results from OneMap unsatisfying for several reasons. The main one is that I was unable to replicate findings from Bredreson etal. using the same data (they used JoinMap). As well the map distances I calculated seemed way off (too big).

So I am trying again with JoinMap.

# Filtering
The vcf files have been filtered using these criteria:
```
    -filter "QD < 2.0" --filter-name "QD2" \
    -filter "QUAL < 20.0" --filter-name "QUAL20" \
    -filter "SOR > 3.0" --filter-name "SOR3" \
    -filter "FS > 60.0" --filter-name "FS60" \
    -filter "MQ < 40.0" --filter-name "MQ40" \
```

Using vcftools I am going to filter a bit more to (1) ensure that >80% of the samples have data and (2) ensure that there is at least 10X coverage per site

```
module load StdEnv/2020 vcftools/0.1.16
vcftools --vcf XX_Chr1_removed.vcf --max-missing 0.8 --min-meanDP 10 --recode --out XX_Chr1_removed_JoinMap
```
